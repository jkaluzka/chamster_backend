- input params validation in datatest data propagation scripts
- extra scripts for test conflicting data
- more data is needed in test scripts
- add swagger ui for rest api documentation
- better handling query params for GET requests in EventApi class
- event db registration timestamp?
- projecttype refactoring - new fields are needed: group projects description,
  single project description
- project name could be saved in settings.py module
